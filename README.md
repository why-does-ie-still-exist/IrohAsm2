# IrohAsm2
*The second-generation Iroh CPU Assembler.*ðŸ˜Ž

This is an assembler that I wrote with ANTLR because rewriting regexes was getting too hard for me. The original can be found [here](https://github.com/why-does-ie-still-exist/IrohAsm).
Because I used ANTLR, adding support for data ranges was much easier, as was writing much more brief, clean code!
This is also my first project with Maven, which is kinda necessary because you have to generate the source files from the ANTLR grammar.
I learned a lot in this project! In the future I'll have to use ANTLR for more regular language/DSL tasks.
